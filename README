## TODO
##
# - model preso, top of hour signals beginning, 45 min signals end
# - gravity to remain during preso
# - handle distance, maybe as min duration in a node, e.g. can't move from room to hallway to new room in .5s
# - dropped samples, e.g. missed enter or leave
# - if preo left between begin & end, should not return until next begin
# - model distance from locations
